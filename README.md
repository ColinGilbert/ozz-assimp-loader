This little project takes Assimp and ozz-animation, then puts them together to import skeletal animations + their corresponding meshes into your game engine, all neatly bundled up and ready for use. Only external dependencies are Assimp and Boost Filesystem (version 3.)

I am actively working on this tool as a part of noobwerkz-engine. It should be feature-complete within the week.

To clone:
```
git clone --recursive https://www.github.com/ColinGilbert/ozz-assimp-loader
```

To use:
```
./mesh_importer <filename>
```
