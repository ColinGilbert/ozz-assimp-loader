This little project takes Assimp and ozz-animation, then puts them together to import skeletal animations into your game engine, all neatly bundled up and ready for use. Only external dependency is Assimp, which most gamedevs should have anyways.

I am actively working on this tool as a part of noobwerkz-engine. It should be feature-complete within the week.
